Description
---

My reads is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) to demonstrate react-fundamentals. The homepage is a list of books categorized into three separate book shelves:

1. Currently Reading
2. Want to Read
3. Read

You can move a book to a category by selected the desired category from the dropdown located at the footer of each book's card.

To add a new book to the homepage, click Search on the top navigation bar. As you begin typing, search results will begin to appear if any books with a title that matches your search are found. Once you have found a book that you would like to move to the homepage, select the appropriate category in the footer of the book's card.

NPM
